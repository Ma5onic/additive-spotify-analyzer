                        The Plotly graph below shows your {{ subheader_message }} top artists. Spotify calculates your favorite
            artists in three time frames:
    <li>Long term - these are your all time 50 favorites since several years (left column)
            <li>Medium term - spans tthe last 6 months (middle column)
            <li>Short term - spans the last four weeks (right column)
<br>
        For long and medium term there are fifty artists but for the short term Spotify calculates maxmium 20 artists.
    In the graph below you can hide and show the artists by clicking on the legend and you can see whether some artists
    have fallen out of favor with you, continue to be your top artists or others which became your favorites recently.
